## Objectives 

We are analyzing a dataset of loanees across several parameters such as income, children, marital status, purpose of loan and education level. Using this analysis, we will attempt to create a report that will aid in the building of a credit score of a potential customer. We will avoid profiling users by gender as the four parameters we need to look for are:

1.Number of children

2.Marital Status

3.Total Income

4.Purpose of Loan
