    "\n",
    "No discernible patterns were detected in the missing values. Since over 10% of the values were missing, the columns could not be dropped. Further on, we will see in detail how the values were dealt with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unclean Data\n",
    "1. The data in `education` column had a case mismatch, causing duplicate values, likely arising from manual entry of data from various sources. We processed this by converting all values in the column to the lower case.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The data in `children` column had negative values and values = 20 children. As these values constituted only **0.5%** of the dataset, they were dropped safely. A likely reason could arise from a different encoding system used at a data collection source where 20 represented 0 or NA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Erroneous Data in Columns\n",
    "1. The `days_employed` column had negative days as well as days exceeding 300,000(800+ years). The negative numbered days were likely a result of a technical glitch assigning a '-' symbol to all values and were fixed by multiplying such values with -1. The other values were considered erroneous and replace with NaN values to fill later in the analysis. The large values tended to be for retirees, indicating an error in data entry or handling for the source where retiree data was obtained. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `dob_years` column has several values as 0. As this constituted only **0.4%** of the dataset, these values were dropped. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `gender` column has 1 erroneous value which was dropped. \n",
    "\n",
    "### De-Duplication\n",
    "1. There were 71 duplicate rows as detected by the in-built pandas function. These rows were dropped immediately.\n",
    "2. The `purpose` column had implicit duplicates likely as the column values were entered manually as a text field. We categorised these values as best as possible by sorting into 4 categories to simplify future analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post Clean Up\n",
    "A total of **98.63%** of values were retained. Missing values still persist and we will solve for these next. Outliers, erroneous values and duplicates have been eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Missing Values\n",
    "The next steps deal with missing values in `total_income` and `days_employed` columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `total_income`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Categorizing Data\n",
    "We categorize numerical and string variables to be able to apply aggregate functions and fill null values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with `dob_years`, we classify this into 10-year age brackets upto 60 years and then group all values 60+ (generally a reasonable retirement age.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Next, a quick peek at the correlations column shows that `education_id` has the most significant correlation with `total_income`. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. We know that `income_type` is likely to affect the `total_income`. Hence, we consider a total of 3 columns affecting `total_income`:\n",
    "    1. `income_type`\n",
    "    2. `education`\n",
    "    3. `age_categories`\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Aggregation and Filling values\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We group the columns and decide to use the median as the fill value to avoid effects of potential outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We use a function to fill the NaN values and drop 2 rows we are unable to fill.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `days_employed`\n",
    "We use already categorized data from the `dob_years` column to fill the missing values in `days_employed`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "The strongest applicable correlation is `dob_years` with a Pearson co-efficient of **0.27**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aggregation and Filling Values\n",
    "\n",
    "We aggreagate and utilize the median, once again, to avoid effects of outliers, especially as the interval sizes are not strictly equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "We have managed to fill the missing values sufficiently accurately. As the `days_employed` column is not relevant to our analysis, we will not worry too much about it going forward. At the end, we have managed to retain **98.6%** of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Categorization\n",
    "The columns we need to categorize are relevant to the questions we need to answer. Let's revisit them: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is there a connection between having kids and repaying a loan on time?\n",
    "2. Is there a connection between marital status and repaying a loan on time?\n",
    "3. Is there a connection between income level and repaying a loan on time?\n",
    "4. How do different loan purposes affect on-time loan repayment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, the columns we need to categorize are:\n",
    "* `children`\n",
    "* `family_status`\n",
    "* `total_income`\n",
    "* `purpose`\n",
    "\n",
    "### `children`\n",
    "We categorize by having children and not having children. We will retain the number of children to assist future anaylsis and create a separate column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `family_status`\n",
    "We categorize this by married or unmarried(currently)\n",
    "\n",
    "### `total_income`\n",
    "We categorize this by the quartile ranges of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `purpose`\n",
    "We categorised this column earlier as a part of our clean up into 4 categories:\n",
    "* real_estate\n",
    "* car\n",
    "* education\n",
    "* wedding\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing the Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypotheses are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is there a connection between having kids and repaying a loan on time?\n",
    "2. Is there a connection between marital status and repaying a loan on time?\n",
    "3. Is there a connection between income level and repaying a loan on time?\n",
    "4. How do different loan purposes affect on-time loan repayment?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of Children:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Having 1 or more children increases the risk of default by a loanee.\n",
    "2. The proportional risk of default (i.e. number of loanees vs number of defaulters) rises with rise in number of children.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Family Status\n",
    "1. Unmarried loanees tend to have worse repayment rates than loanees who are married.\n",
    "2. A closer look indicates that civil partnerships have the highest proportional rate of default.\n",
    "3. Divorced or Widow/Widower loanees tend to have proportionally lower rates of defualt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Income Category\n",
    "1. Proportionally higher rates of default occur in the 25%-75% range of incomes. \n",
    "2. The highest proportional rate of default is in the 25%-50% range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "1. Real Estate defaults are proportionally lower\n",
    "2. Car and Education loans see proportionally higher defaults.\n",
    "3. Car loans have the highest proportional default rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have successfully analyzed the data set and are ready to present our findings to drive better decision making when alloting credit scores and sanctioning loans."
